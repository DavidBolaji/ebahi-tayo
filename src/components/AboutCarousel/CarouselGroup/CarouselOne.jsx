            As a Ministry gift, in the last 20 years, I have worked at the core
            of my lifeâ€™s assignment with the mandate to continuously raise a
            sound that beckons on God's sons and daughters to worship their
            creator in the pureness of heart through the instrumentality and
            power of Songs.

            I am a strong voice of worship, an outstanding vocalist and a
            songwriter. I am a lady with a tender heart that pants after God,
            and one with such great commitment to her music ministry
          </p>

          <p className=" text-slate-600  text-[14px] font-semibold">
            Growing up, I always had an intense passion and talent for music. I
            started writing songs at the tender age of 13.

            My music ministry started in the Churches of God, where I had
            opportunities to sing at youth camp meetings and special events
            organized by the church. My passion has seen me grow my craft as
            member of the Anointed, the music ministry of Harvesthouse Christian
            center where I developed capacity in songwriting, song leading and
            dynamics of the field of music under Senior pastors Revd. and Pastor
            Mrs. Gbeminiyi Eboda under whom I learnt the very essence of worship
            and a heart of service and has actively served as Worship leader for
            more than two decades.

            purpose towards fulfilling the mission of the kingdom of God on
            earth. This concerts has grown from Nigerian campuses into interior
            communities within Nigeria t o the glory of God alone.
